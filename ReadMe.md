# Kubernetes
***

## Introduction
- **Kubernetes** (also known as k8s) is meant to run across a cluster environment. 
- It is meant to coordinate clusters of nodes at scale in production in an efficient manner. While Docker provides an open standard for packaging and distributing containerised apps, the potential complexities can add up fast. 
- How do you coordinate and schedule several containers? How do all of the different containers in your app talk to each other? How do you scale several container instances? This is where Kubernetes can help. 
- It contains all the parts and glue to form a resilient and reliable way of running services, including things like load balancers, resource quotas, scaling policies, traffic management, sharing secrets, and more.

## Kubernetes vs. Docker
- Simplistically kubernetes is more extensive than Docker. In another words, kubernetes helps orchastrates several dockers.

## Use Kubernetes with Docker
In short, use Kubernetes with Docker to:
  - Make your infrastructure more robust and your app more highly available. Your app will remain online, even if some of the nodes go offline.
  - Make your application more scalable. If your app starts to get a lot more load and you need to scale out to be able to provide a better user experience, it’s simple to spin up more containers or add more nodes to your Kubernetes cluster.
